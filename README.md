# gcloudDiscordBot
Allows a user on discord to interact (turn on) a google cloud instance.

In order for the code to function, one must not only already have a Discord bot created and have its token, but also have a Google Cloud account that has a access to the correct instance.
If one doesn't, there are plenty of handy resources online to acquire the necessary prerequisites.

Before running the script, be sure to switch to a virtual environment, have Discord.py installed, and logged into Google Cloud.
